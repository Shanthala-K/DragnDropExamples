      1.1. Simple definition for drag & drop
      
      In computer graphical user interface drag & drop is the action of clicking on an object (virtual object on the screen) and dragging itto different location            (on screen) as required.

      The basic sequence involved in drag & drop is

      1. Press and hold down the button on the mouse or the other pointing device to “grab” the object.
      2. Drag” the object/cursor/pointing device to the desired location.
      3. “Drop”the object by releasing the button.

      Example:

      A simple drag & drop sequence is given below.

      Fig1 contains 2 columns: first column contains animal names and second column contains small boxes where relevant images are dropped.

      1.2 How Drag and Drop works

      Drag and drop is actually the same as cutting and pasting (or copying and pasting) using the mouse instead of keyboard. In both cases you have source (where you are cutting or copying from) and a target (where you are pasting to). During either operation, a copy of the data is maintained in memory. Cut and paste uses clipboard; drag and drop uses a data object, which is in essence private clipboard.
